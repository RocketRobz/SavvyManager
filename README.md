* When importing a character from those games, you can press L or R to select the seasonal outfit.     (Note that not all characters will have seasonal outfits.)

* Coming soon: Change attributes of your character (such as gender, skin color, pose set, height, etc.).
* Coming soon (GM4/SS4/NSB3): Change bow placement on your character, if a bow is being worn.

Before using Savvy Manager, it is recommended to back up your Girls Mode/Style Savvy/Style Boutique game save(s) using Checkpoint, in case something goes wrong.

**WARNING**     
Star Stylist/Styling Star players, if you're playing as a male character, or as a female character with a unique eye shape (ex. Ang√©lique), it is highly recommended you don't update your shop data at Shopdo.
As such features are not normally available in-game, you may risk a possible ban when doing so, as the character data will be part of your Shopdo.
